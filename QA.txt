Data Driven Testing using cucumber:
========================================

Data Tables  ---------------   Large sets of data


Scenario Outlines ---------- 
	Examples


Testiing Framework:
=========================================

To organize the code artifacts and control the test execution.

Keyword driven: Keyword driven is nothing but the reusable methods in which we can pass the argmuments.
		Driver class is the keyword in this.
Data driven

Hybrid: = Keyword driven and Data driven framework.
		It will have different packages or components.
==================================================================================================

These are the components or packages of the Hybrid driven framework.

	Reusable methods
	Object Repository
	Data sheets
		- Test cases - All the names of the test cases are present. and also execute flag (it is a controller  .
		- Test steps
		- Test data
	Driver Class- it is the heart of the framework 

	Results - We will have the reports stored
		html report
		drill drown report
	
	Config file --  all the environmental details (config.properties)
		url--
		environments - (SIT, QA, UAT etc).
			username:
			password:
			browser :

In this framework we are having different components. We store all the objects in the object repositor, and we store the data sheets in three differnet sheets
	Test cases: We write the high level description of the test cases
	Test steps: We write the steps of the to perform the test cases
	Test data : Here we write the data that is input for the test steps Eg: usernames, pwds etc.,
